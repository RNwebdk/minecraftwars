It started with a regular game of memory, but then got boring very fast. So I made a mix of lives and points to make it more interesting, challenging and fun and ended up with a pretty good result, for a first game. 

My kid asked me why I use so much time on the computer and when i told him that I was programming, he didn't really understand, so I wanted to show him what a programmer was able to do. Maybe this will motivate him in the future to start coding himself. I sure hope he'll follow my footsteps one day :)
